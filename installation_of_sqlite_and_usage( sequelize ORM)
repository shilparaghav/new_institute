As we are using sequelize ORM it supports multiple databases.
kepp in mind we should have used sequelize ORM for database operations in our project and for that sequelize and sequelize-cli package installed in our project only then we can switch from one database to another.
so in order to change from one database to another without changing the whole code in project.


open existing project folder in Vscode or in any of editor:

open cmd console to install sqlite3 database shell:
sudo apt-get install sqlite3

===> we first need to install package sqlite3 using npm install sqlite3 --save in project as dependency
then create sqlite3 database file in root directory of project. sqlite3 has a database file named for example: databasename.extension  i.e our databasename is institute and extension is sqlite3. extension may vary from version to version.

Database Creation: for creating database we will go to our project folder using command line or bydefault if we open project using vscode ther we automatically there in root directory  of project.
connect to the database fire below command
sqlite3 institute.sqlite3 // Here institute is our databasename and .sqlite3 is extension.

:::bydefault when we create database file it is not shown ,so in order to see that 
we type command  .databases further then database file will get visible to us in project root folder as we have created file there.

example: sqlite3 institute.sqlite3
	SQLite version 3.11.0 2016-02-15 17:29:24
	Enter ".help" for usage hints.
	sqlite> .databases
	seq  name             file
	---  ---------------  ----------------------------------------------------------
	0    main             /home/wegile/institute/institute.sqlite3
	sqlite>

==> now go to config.json file and just type dialect : sqlite ,storage : /institute.sqite3 and remove all other parameters username, host,password and database from config.json file.
example :
{
    "development": {
        "dialect": "sqlite",
        "storage": "./institute.sqlite3"
    },
    "test": {
        "dialect": "sqlite",
        "storage": ":memory"
    },
    "production": {
        "dialect": "sqlite",
        "storage": "./institute.sqlite3"
    }
}
==> now download DB browser for SQlite (which is a GUI for Sqlite) from any of browser.
==>  now npm start.
==> then run migrations using command:  node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate. if we run migrations using command- sequelize db:migrate then it may give you error.
==> and then run seeders if u wish using : node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:seed:all

NOTE : Whenever we want to see created datbases or tables or new created database go to  project folder in commandline and type  sqlite3 dbname.sqlite3(example: sqlite3 institute.sqlite3) then we enter into it only then .database or .tables command will run. And databases and tables-if exist get visualized.
